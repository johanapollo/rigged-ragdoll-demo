# Rigged Ragdoll Demo

This project demonstrates how to combine a rigged GLTF model with Ammo.js physics to simulate a ragdoll in low gravity using Three.js.

## Setup

1. Place your rigged `.glb` model in the root directory and name it `model.glb`.
2. Serve the project with a static server, e.g.:

```
npx serve .
```

## Requirements

- three.js (ESM)
- ammo.js
- GLTFLoader
